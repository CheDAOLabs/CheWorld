## **Project Introduction**

****Introduction****

Talas is an all-chain multiplayer online game integrating various gameplay, including resource collection, item synthesis, monster fighting, dungeon challenges, and card duels.

We have been cooperating with the Realms team and studied the code of the loot-survivor project. We used the indexer of the loot-survivor project at the code level and combined their character and monster systems. We are willing to expand based on the architecture of the loot-survivor project and extend more of our own unique gameplay.

****Project Components****

**Core Background:** On an old continent called "Talas", there is a legend of a hidden underground palace—"Mystic Forest Dungeon". It is full of crises and opportunities, hiding ancient secrets and endless treasures. To explore it, adventurers need to first find resources, forge equipment, and strengthen themselves on this continent.

**Resources & Environment:** There are various special geographical environments on the Talas continent—volcanoes, ice fields, forests, deserts, etc. Each environment has its unique resources. For example, Fire Stone can be collected in volcanic areas, and Ice Crystal is found in ice field areas.

**Equipment & Skills:** On this continent, there are four legendary blacksmiths, each of whom is proficient in a certain manufacturing skill. Players need to find them, learn skills, or trade with them to get special equipment.

**Enemies & Creatures:** In addition to resources, there are various wild animals and monsters on the continent. Some creatures are friendly and can be tamed or traded with. Some creatures will attack players, but defeating them can get precious materials.

**Ancient Civilizations & Relics:** During the exploration process, players can encounter ancient civilization relics. There may be mechanisms, puzzles, and traps, but there may also be ancient manufacturing techniques and equipment hidden.

**Mystic Forest Dungeon:** When players are ready, they can try to explore the Mystic Forest Dungeon. It's a huge maze with dangerous enemies, complex mechanisms, and endless treasures. Moreover, the structure and content of the dungeon will change each time you enter, making each exploration full of freshness.

**Card Duels:** Adventurers on the continent turn the monsters they encounter into cards for battles. This is a 1V1 duel form agreed upon between the tribes of the Talas continent, and it has also become a popular form of entertainment among adventurers.

****World View****

The worldview is consistent with the project components described above.

## **Continental Adventure**

****About the Character****

**Background:** Each adventurer is magically transported to the Talas continent. They carry different CheCells, and they can return to their original world only after completely conquering all the dungeons on the Talas continent.

**Character Creation:** Players need to answer some questions to determine character attributes, which will impact the subsequent combat process.

****About the Tribe****

The tribe is a place for players to socialize and rest. You can chat, trade, and forge items in the tribe. The current maximum number of people in a single tribe is 100. People from the same tribe do not need to spend money to share resources. Users from different tribes need to use transportation to transport resources.

**Forge Items:** Players can forge items by consuming materials. Different types of items require the consumption of various resources. You can increase your combat power by forging equipment and create food to restore your health or stamina.

****About Resources****

Resources are divided into three types: animals, plants, and minerals. Some resources will recover over a fixed period of time, and some rare resources will be provided in limited quantities. We hope that players can use resources reasonably.

## **Challenge the Dungeon**

**Background:** Hidden deep under the Talas continent are a series of mysterious dungeons, which are completely different from the scenery and civilization on the continent. These dungeons are not the work of the indigenous inhabitants of the Talas continent, but come from a distant, unknown civilization. Their depth and complexity are almost beyond people's imagination.

**Introduction:** There are more than 9,000 dungeons hidden in the Talas continent, each with rare treasures. The main purpose of the adventurers coming to this continent is to conquer these dungeons.

**Core:** Each dungeon will use the C&C map generation, including all data from C&C. The core gameplay is TBS (Turn-Based Strategy games). At the same time, we will use the Unity engine for development to pursue better game performance.

**Gameplay Introduction**

Different dungeons will contain different terrains and monster types. Players need to use the cards they got reasonably each round.
